If you do not see the Managed Software Center appear, you may need to update your Mac OS. 

From the Apple menu ï£¿ in the corner of your screen, choose System Settings or System Preferences
If you chose __System Settings__, click __General__ on the left side of the window. Then click __Software Update__ on the right.
If you chose __System Preferences__, click __Software Update__ in the window.
Software Update then checks for new software. 
If Software Update finds new software, click the button to install it. The button might be named Update Now, Upgrade Now, Install Now, or Restart Now, for example. You might then be asked to enter your administrator password.
If Software Update says that your Mac is up to date, then no new software is currently available for your Mac model. Software Update shows only software that is compatible with your Mac.
