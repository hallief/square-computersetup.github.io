# Cloudflare WARP VPN

The Cloudflare WARP Client enables Block to protect corporate devices by securely and privately routing their traffic through Cloudflare’s global network, where Cloudflare Gateway applies advanced web filtering. This all-in-one VPN and web security solution replaces both the Ivanti VPN client and Umbrella. Unlike Ivanti, WARP runs continuously, so you don’t need to remember to connect to the VPN.

The Cloudflare WARP VPN is already installed on your MacBook. Select the Cloudflare WARP icon <img src="/assets/images/Cloudfare-WARP.png" width='25' height='5' /> near the clock in the top-right corner of your MacBook.

* You will be prompted to authenticate via Okta the first time you use Cloudflare WARP.

* After authenticating, Cloudflare WARP will prompt you to re-authenticate daily to connect.

As long as it says __Connected__, you're all set!
