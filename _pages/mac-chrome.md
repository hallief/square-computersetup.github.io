## Setting up Okta Fastpass to work with Google Chrome

__Note:__ If you don’t see the Okta Verify app on your computer, please don't install it from the App store. Ensure that you have completed all updates from the [Managed Software Center &rarr;](/_pages/mac-installs.md/). If the Managed Software Center is not on your computer, please follow this [link &rarr;](/_pages/mac-mdm.md) to manually install it. It is critical for Okta Verify to be installed by the Managed Software Center.  

Okta FastPass provides a quick, easy and secure way to sign in and helps protect you from phishing.

Before setting up Okta Verify, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on both your MacBook and on your mobile device. 

To confirm this on your MacBook, click on the Control Center icon in the top right corner.
